# .github
A **.github repository**  is a special space on GitHub used to show the README.md file on our profile and repo-wide settings, such as issue and pull request templates, funding links, contributing guidelines, and workflows. It helps standardize and automate collaboration by providing shared templates and configurations across a single repository or even all repositories in our github organization.
